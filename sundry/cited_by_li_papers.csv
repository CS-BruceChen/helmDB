We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.","['53e99ca8b7602d970255686e', '53e9b58db7602d97040ce976', '53e9b9f5b7602d97045f3583', '53e9bc97b7602d9704919b80', '53e9b7e8b7602d970439aaf9', '53e9ac42b7602d970360f828', '53e9b153b7602d9703bd99ed', '56d81390dabfae2eee62543c', '557ee0ebd19faf961d16d252', '53e99d29b7602d97025e0eb7', '53e99b8db7602d9702437368', '53e99c04b7602d97024b1d56', '53e9af26b7602d970395df18', '53e9b75ab7602d97042fd5af', '53e9a3e7b7602d9702cfebc6', '557ee0d2d19faf961d16d246', '53e9af61b7602d97039a64da', '53e9b60db7602d9704160535', '53e9a98eb7602d97032e6d9a', '53e99d87b7602d9702644e1d', '53e99a7fb7602d97022f103f', '53e9a570b7602d9702e98ff8', '53e99967b7602d97021aa04f', '53e9baa0b7602d97046cacc9', '53e9b7d9b7602d9704389448', '558a309be4b0b32fcb355883', '53e9bdcdb7602d9704a7e819']"

Since all documents are not of equal relevance to their users, highly relevant documents should be identified and ranked first for presentation. In order to develop IR techniques in this direction, it is necessary to develop evaluation approaches and methods that credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This can be done by extending traditional evaluation methods, that is, recall and precision based on binary relevance judgments, to graded relevance judgments. Alternatively, novel measures based on graded relevance judgments may be developed. This article proposes several novel measures that compute the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. The first one accumulates the relevance scores of retrieved documents along the ranked result list. The second one is similar but applies a discount factor to the relevance scores in order to devaluate late-retrieved documents. The third one computes the relative-to-the-ideal performance of IR techniques, based on the cumulative gain they are able to yield. These novel measures are defined and discussed and their use is demonstrated in a case study using TREC data: sample system run results for 20 queries in TREC-7. As a relevance base we used novel graded relevance judgments on a four-point scale. The test results indicate that the proposed measures credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents and allow testing of statistical significance of effectiveness differences. The graphs based on the measures also provide insight into the performance IR techniques and allow interpretation, for example, from the user point of view.","['53e9aafab7602d9703479b01', '53e99f9bb7602d9702871e7d', '53e9bb7ab7602d97047bdfdd', '53e9bc68b7602d97048e3e1b', '53e9b35ab7602d9703e366f0', '53e99818b7602d97020339c1', '53e9aef1b7602d970391c37f', '53e9b6e2b7602d9704275b58', '53e9b52db7602d9704066ded', '53e9abf1b7602d97035b3009', '53e99ae2b7602d970236b6bd', '53e9a018b7602d97028f96f2', '53e9acf6b7602d97036d2543', '53e9b9e1b7602d97045d8deb', '53e9a869b7602d97031b3e59', '53e9b188b7602d9703c10cc7', '53e99bf7b7602d970249fc45', '53e9aafab7602d970347a4c4', '53e9b75bb7602d97043005d3']"

One application of crowdsourcing is to outsource certain tasks to the crowd that are difficult to implement in software. Another potential benefit of crowdsourcing is the on-demand allocation of a flexible workforce. Businesses may outsource tasks to the crowd based on temporary workload variations. A major challenge in crowdsourcing is to guarantee high-quality processing of tasks. We present a novel crowdsourcing marketplace that matches tasks to suitable workers based on auctions. The key to ensuring high quality lies in skilled members whose capabilities can be estimated correctly. We present a novel auction mechanism for skill evolution that helps to correctly estimate workers and to evolve skills that are needed. Evaluations show that this leads to improved crowdsourcing.,"['558af91ae4b0b32fcb39fc84', '53e99ed8b7602d97027a1880', '53e9ba6ab7602d970468b79d', '53e99bcdb7602d9702474767', '53e9ac22b7602d97035e6bce', '53e9980eb7602d97020226c7', '53e99967b7602d97021aa842', '53e9a870b7602d97031bdcda', '53e9b983b7602d9704571397']"

Despite a few recent advances, this problem remains challenging for at least two reasons. First, web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of con- tent, rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inappli- cable. Second, the scale of most web services of practical interest calls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation. In this work, we model personalized recommendation of news articles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serve users based on contextual information about the users and articles, while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we propose a new, general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationally efficient and well motivated from learning theory. Second, we ar- gue that any bandit algorithm can be reliably evaluated offline us- ing previously recorded random traffic. Finally, using this offline evaluation method, we successfully applied our new algorithm to a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module dataset containing over 33 million events. Results showed a 12.5% click lift compared to a standard context-free bandit algorithm, and the advantage becomes even greater when data gets more scarce.","['53e9b57cb7602d97040b876f', '53e9ad18b7602d97036f6d9e', '53e9a27ab7602d9702b834ba', '558b6757e4b037c0875cb201', '53e9b0abb7602d9703b1a96a', '53e9b5fab7602d970414d89e', '53e9ae8ab7602d97038aa653', '53e9bccbb7602d970494f90e', '53e99f03b7602d97027d27e1', '53e9ba1db7602d970462744b', '53e9b0c7b7602d9703b3ab39', '53e9ae29b7602d970383bef5', '53e9a70bb7602d970303ede0', '53e9ad8db7602d9703787cb4', '53e9aad9b7602d9703459cee', '53e9b017b7602d9703a72d1a', '53e9bae6b7602d970471718e']"

In crowdsourcing paradigm, tasks are distributed to networked people to complete such that a company's production cost can be greatly reduced. In crowdsourcing systems, task recommendation can help workers to find their right tasks faster as well as help requesters to receive good quality output quicker. However, previously proposed classification based task recommendation approach, which is the only one in the literature, does not consider the dynamic scenarios of new workers and new tasks in the crowdsourcing system. In this paper, we propose a Task Recommendation (TaskRec) framework based on a unified probabilistic matrix factorization, aiming to recommend tasks to workers in dynamic scenarios. Unlike traditional recommendation systems, workers do not provide their ratings on tasks in crowdsourcing systems, thus we infer user ratings from their interacting behaviors. This conversion helps task recommendation in crowdsourcing systems. Complexity analysis shows that our framework is efficient and is scalable to large datasets. Finally, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets for performance evaluation.

In this paper, we try to address this challenge by introducing a recurrent deep neural network (NN) for real-time financial signal representation and trading. Our model is inspired by two biological-related learning concepts of deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the framework, the DL part automatically senses the dynamic market condition for informative feature learning. Then, the RL module interacts with deep representations and makes trading decisions to accumulate the ultimate rewards in an unknown environment. The learning system is implemented in a complex NN that exhibits both the deep and recurrent structures. Hence, we propose a task-aware backpropagation through time method to cope with the gradient vanishing issue in deep training. The robustness of the neural system is verified on both the stock and the commodity future markets under broad testing conditions.","['5550431145ce0a409eb45cec', '53e99da4b7602d970265f665', '53e9afbab7602d9703a074c5', '53e9b388b7602d9703e6b5da', '53e9af06b7602d9703939860', '53e9a2c0b7602d9702bc77ee', '53e9bac9b7602d97046f55f1', '5a73cb8717c44a0b3035b893', '558c90d4e4b02b9f07a7d5e9', '557ee0d2d19faf961d16d246', '53e9a841b7602d970318ca16', '53e99f64b7602d97028389c2', '53e99e7fb7602d9702740ffd', '53e9bcadb7602d970492cc34', '55a6bae665ce054aad73115b', '555041bf45ce0a409eb3d819', '558c9ee2e4b0cfb70a1eb7a8', '53e99e21b7602d97026e7e8e', '557edb976fee0fe990cacefd', '53e9b6a2b7602d970421d928', '53e998c7b7602d97020fe9f5', '55323e6345cec66b6f9e34f7', '53e99dccb7602d970268a977', '558aba9be4b0b32fcb38836c', '53e99afeb7602d970238e1fc', '558a9da7e4b0b32fcb37d87f', '558a829ee4b031bae1f81026', '53e9a9ccb7602d970332ef01', '60376781d3485cfff1dc0847', '53e99991b7602d97021d2b83']"

It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.","['53e99813b7602d970202935d', '53e99b2cb7602d97023c9acf', '53e9a1bdb7602d9702ab61f2', '53e99c36b7602d97024e3227', '53e9b1a9b7602d9703c341ac', '53e9bde1b7602d9704a8fef4', '53e99ed8b7602d97027a2213', '53e9aa8eb7602d97034061b9', '53e9a63eb7602d9702f6f612', '53e9a9b0b7602d9703310525', '53e99afeb7602d970238e18a', '53e9af6eb7602d97039b3c9f', '573696136e3b12023e5260c1', '5550417845ce0a409eb3b960', '53e9b19cb7602d9703c28e5a', '55a6bae665ce054aad73115b', '53e9a1c9b7602d9702ac1cfa', '53e9bae6b7602d970471718e']"

In these games, all interactions in the virtual world are through text and the underlying state is not observed. The resulting language barrier makes such environments challenging for automatic game players. We employ a deep reinforcement learning framework to jointly learn state representations and action policies using game rewards as feedback. This framework enables us to map text descriptions into vector representations that capture the semantics of the game states. We evaluate our approach on two game worlds, comparing against baselines using bag-of-words and bag-of-bigrams for state representations. Our algorithm outperforms the baselines on both worlds demonstrating the importance of learning expressive representations.

This paper considers the online spatial task assignment problem. In this problem, spatial tasks arrive in an online manner and an appropriate worker must be assigned to each task. However, outcome of an assignment is stochastic since the worker can choose to accept or reject the task. Primary goal of the assignment algorithm is to maximize the number of successful assignments over all tasks. This presents an exploration-exploitation challenge, the algorithm must learn the task acceptance behavior of workers while selecting the best worker based on the previous learning. We address this challenge by defining a framework for online spatial task assignment based on the multi-armed bandit formalization of the problem. Furthermore, we adapt a contextual bandit algorithm to assign a worker based on the spatial features of tasks and workers. The algorithm simultaneously adapts the worker assignment strategy based on the observed task acceptance behavior of workers. Finally, we present an evaluation methodology based on a real world dataset, and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm against the baseline algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs better in terms of the number of successful assignments.","['53e9afbab7602d9703a07bcc', '53e9b137b7602d9703bb7e74', '53e9a48eb7602d9702dabd80', '53e9ba6ab7602d970468cc97', '558bed6de4b02b9f07a4139f', '53e9b110b7602d9703b8fcf8', '53e99afeb7602d970238e1fc', '53e9bb15b7602d97047525d8', '558bda7284ae6766fdef9cb6', '53e9b31bb7602d9703de33f9', '55323b8e45cec66b6f9da25b', '53e9b0e6b7602d9703b60e78', '558c4f5de4b00c3c48e18b63', '53e9ba8bb7602d97046b22b6', '53e9bae6b7602d970471718e', '53e9b5b6b7602d97040ff197']"

These tasks, such as entity resolution, sentiment analysis, and image recognition can be enhanced through the use of human cognitive ability. Crowdsouring platforms are an effective way to harness the capabilities of people (i.e., the crowd) to apply human computation for such tasks. Thus, crowdsourced data management has become an area of increasing interest in research and industry. We identify three important problems in crowdsourced data management. (1) Quality Control: Workers may return noisy or incorrect results so effective techniques are required to achieve high quality; (2) Cost Control: The crowd is not free, and cost control aims to reduce the monetary cost; (3) Latency Control: The human workers can be slow, particularly compared to automated computing time scales, so latency-control techniques are required. There has been significant work addressing these three factors for designing crowdsourced tasks, developing crowdsourced data manipulation operators, and optimizing plans consisting of multiple operators. In this paper, we survey and synthesize a wide spectrum of existing studies on crowdsourced data management. Based on this analysis we then outline key factors that need to be considered to improve crowdsourced data management.","['53e99af2b7602d970237c7d3', '53e9afbab7602d9703a07bcc', '53e9bc15b7602d970487a5f7', '5550449845ce0a409eb4f1cb', '53e99884b7602d97020bc8f2', '573697db6e3b12023e6b9a9d', '55465d5f0cf2939c2fee6c9f', '55323b9245cec66b6f9da2e4', '53e9b90bb7602d97044f08af', '558c73d6e4b02b9f07a730a7', '5c7a38a04895d9cbc6c4dccb', '573695506e3b12023e47bd9c', '573695506e3b12023e47beb4', '53e99ebdb7602d970278505e', '53e9b4abb7602d9703fb9c5c', '53e9a533b7602d9702e586f2', '53e9bb7ab7602d97047bfa17', '557c6362f66765fbb46b1ad2', '53e9af3ab7602d9703977a0f', '53e9b321b7602d9703dea1b7', '599c7f08601a182cd28e5c51', '53e9afa0b7602d97039ee007', '53e9b03db7602d9703a9c4f3', '53e9980eb7602d9702021aa2', '53e9b71db7602d97042b6e52', '53e9a8ffb7602d970324ec41', '53e9ba95b7602d97046bebf8', '53e99dc5b7602d9702686b08', '53e99afeb7602d970238e1fc', '53e9a8ccb7602d970321df3b', '558bc9e3e4b00c3c48de7a77', '53e9aa5cb7602d97033cbba0', '555048d745ce0a409eb71e84', '53e9a2f3b7602d9702bfc75a', '573697c86e3b12023e6a80e0', '53e9bbdbb7602d970482f568', '53e9ba60b7602d9704677f0d', '53e9af46b7602d9703984be0', '53e99ad7b7602d9702358f91', '53e99b71b7602d9702415552', '55323b9245cec66b6f9da2e6', '53e9a946b7602d9703299786', '53e99804b7602d97020182d1', '555048b845ce0a409eb70bef', '53e9b32bb7602d9703dfc4d7', '53e9bc10b7602d9704878563', '5736985a6e3b12023e71ffaa', '53e99e5bb7602d9702720a0d', '55323b8f45cec66b6f9da274', '55323b9145cec66b6f9da2c6', '53e9ba59b7602d970467303a', '555048b745ce0a409eb70b6c', '53e9a3d4b7602d9702ce885c', '53e9ba6ab7602d970468cc97', '53e9affab7602d9703a51b1b', '53e9a472b7602d9702d8cf24', '53e9b998b7602d97045875d4', '53e9b02fb7602d9703a8e433', '53e99a0ab7602d9702257e26', '53e9a48eb7602d9702dabd80', '53e9bd9fb7602d9704a4be6e', '53e9b2f4b7602d9703db0b94', '53e99e80b7602d9702748127', '58d82fa5d649053542fd01f2', '558c4a14e4b0cfb70a1ccc75', '5736985a6e3b12023e72008d', '53e999f5b7602d970223b7b2', '53e99a0ab7602d9702257f4b', '56d81382dabfae2eee61fc9a', '5550440a45ce0a409eb4ae22', '56d8141edabfae2eee65fa67', '53e9a609b7602d9702f35f7e', '555048d245ce0a409eb71b83', '53e9b0f5b7602d9703b72efc', '53e9bdc6b7602d9704a76017', '53e9ba8bb7602d97046b22b6', '53e9b693b7602d9704203a99', '57d063e0ac44367354294a66', '555048d745ce0a409eb71ea0', '53e9adf1b7602d97037fd9c4', '53e9a06cb7602d9702950c2f', '573697e86e3b12023e6c5141', '558c3c28e4b00c3c48e10dd2', '53e9bafbb7602d9704733a9d', '5550449945ce0a409eb4f1fb', '55323b8e45cec66b6f9da25b', '53e99ac4b7602d97023407fe', '53e9b451b7602d9703f509b9', '555048b745ce0a409eb70b8e', '53e9b75ab7602d97042fd3d5', '53e9a480b7602d9702d9dd10', '573695516e3b12023e47c23b', '57d063e0ac4436735429498e', '599e43470cf290ebfabde1c8', '558ab97be4b031bae1f94db2', '53e9adb6b7602d97037b5dc7', '555048b645ce0a409eb70b25', '5550450a45ce0a409eb53226', '573698596e3b12023e71fd5d', '53e9b108b7602d9703b875a2', '53e9b798b7602d97043409a6', '573697c16e3b12023e6a24de', '5550427945ce0a409eb428f4', '53e9ab2bb7602d97034b5ceb', '53e9a863b7602d97031ad404', '53e9a02db7602d9702913374', '53e9a9f7b7602d9703360d27', '53e99a4eb7602d97022ae1c3', '53e9b8e1b7602d97044c3b05', '53e99d88b7602d97026461e0', '55323bd245cec66b6f9daa6c', '53e9a855b7602d970319d5d4', '53e999ffb7602d970224b36f', '53e9ac28b7602d97035eb779', '53e99abeb7602d970233f039', '53e9af7ab7602d97039bd7f2', '55323b9045cec66b6f9da2a5', '53e9b5e0b7602d970412f94a']"

However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing hand-engineered policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep reinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose neural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively simple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on off-policy training of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation tasks and can learn deep neural network policies efficiently enough to train on real physical robots. We demonstrate that the training times can be further reduced by parallelizing the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can learn a variety of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a complex door opening skill on real robots without any prior demonstrations or manually designed representations.","['53e9ae6fb7602d970388c5b0', '573696ce6e3b12023e5ceb4f', '53e9b5b6b7602d97040ff749', '5736960a6e3b12023e51d64d', '53e9a3b9b7602d9702cc9cb8', '557c4c4af66765fbb46adfdc', '558b345de4b031bae1fc1507', '558c8dd3e4b02b9f07a7c4c0', '53e9b0bcb7602d9703b2f143', '53e9ad6cb7602d9703756adf', '573697196e3b12023e60e454', '53e99e04b7602d97026c5416', '53e9b4abb7602d9703fbc1b3', '53e9bb5ab7602d9704798b31', '53e9b8e1b7602d97044c4523', '53e9a4ebb7602d9702e09e59', '5550411245ce0a409eb385fb', '53e9aa02b7602d970336ce11', '55a6bae665ce054aad73115b', '53e9a48db7602d9702da9bcd', '53e9b4efb7602d9704019268', '58437725ac44360f108300e8', '558c5232e4b0cfb70a1d005f', '53e9a374b7602d9702c83470', '5550415745ce0a409eb3a739', '53e99e99b7602d97027609dd', '55465e550cf2939c2feeaa40', '53e9a819b7602d970315f0f7', '53e99b04b7602d9702391d36', '573696026e3b12023e516372', '53e9b5e7b7602d970413af4f', '573696ce6e3b12023e5ce95a', '53e9a4a3b7602d9702dc2c39']"

Most existing approaches utilize hand-crafted features for each modality independently and combine them in a heuristic manner. They often fail to consider the consistency and complementary information among features adequately, which makes them difficult to capture high-level semantic structures. The features learned by most of the current deep learning methods can obtain high-quality image classification results. However, these methods are hard to be applied to recognize 3D point clouds due to unorganized distribution and various point density of data. In this paper, we propose a 3DCNN-DQN-RNN method which fuses the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Residual recurrent neural network (RNN)for an efficient semantic parsing of large-scale 3D point clouds. In our method, an eye window under control of the 3D CNN and DQN can localize and segment the points of the objectu0027s class efficiently. The 3D CNN and Residual RNN further extract robust and discriminative features of the points in the eye window, and thus greatly enhance the parsing accuracy of large-scale point clouds.

The vast majority of traditional recommender systems consider the recommendation procedure as a static process and make recommendations following a fixed strategy. In this paper, we propose a novel recommender system with the capability of continuously improving its strategies during the interactions with users. We model the sequential interactions between users and a recommender system as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automatically learn the optimal strategies via recommending trial-and-error items and receiving reinforcements of these items from users' feedback. Users' feedback can be positive and negative and both types of feedback have great potentials to boost recommendations. However, the number of negative feedback is much larger than that of positive one; thus incorporating them simultaneously is challenging since positive feedback could be buried by negative one. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to incorporate them into the proposed deep recommender system (DEERS) framework. The experimental results based on real-world e-commerce data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further experiments have been conducted to understand the importance of both positive and negative feedback in recommendations.

Online personalized news recommendation is a highly challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of news features and user preferences. Although some online recommendation models have been proposed to address the dynamic nature of news recommendation, these methods have three major issues. First, they only try to model current reward (e.g., Click Through Rate). Second, very few studies consider to use user feedback other than click / no click labels (e.g., how frequent user returns) to help improve recommendation. Third, these methods tend to keep recommending similar news to users, which may cause users to get bored. Therefore, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Deep Q-Learning based recommendation framework, which can model future reward explicitly. We further consider user return pattern as a supplement to click / no click label in order to capture more user feedback information. In addition, an effective exploration strategy is incorporated to find new attractive news for users. Extensive experiments are conducted on the offline dataset and online production environment of a commercial news recommendation application and have shown the superior performance of our methods.

These unique features make traditional recommendation approaches no longer satisfactory for task and worker recommendation in crowdsourcing systems. In this article, we propose a two-tier data representation scheme (defining a worker--category suitability score and a worker--task attractiveness score) to support personalized task and worker recommendations. We also extend two optimization methods, namely least mean square error and Bayesian personalized rank, to better fit the characteristics of task/worker recommendation in crowdsourcing systems. We then integrate the proposed representation scheme and the extended optimization methods along with the two adapted popular learning models, i.e., matrix factorization and kNN, and result in two lines of top-N recommendation algorithms for crowdsourcing systems: (1) Top-N-Tasks recommendation algorithms for discovering the top-N most suitable tasks for a given worker and (2) Top-N-Workers recommendation algorithms for identifying the top-N best workers for a task requester. An extensive experimental study is conducted that validates the effectiveness and efficiency of a broad spectrum of algorithms, accompanied by our analysis and the insights gained.

We present an attention-based neural network module, the Set Transformer, specifically designed to model interactions among elements in the input set. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which rely on attention mechanisms. In an effort to reduce computational complexity, we introduce an attention scheme inspired by inducing point methods from sparse Gaussian process literature. It reduces the computation time of self-attention from quadratic to linear in the number of elements in the set.

Past studies lack practicability in terms of both problem formulation and solution framework. On the one hand, some problem settings in prior online bipartite graph matching research are impractical for real-world applications. On the other hand, existing solutions to online bipartite graph matching are inefficient due to the unnecessary real-time decision making. In this paper, we propose the dynamic bipartite graph matching (DBGM) problem to be better aligned with real-world applications and devise a novel adaptive batch-based solution framework with a constant competitive ratio. As an effective and efficient implementation of the solution framework, we design a reinforcement learning based algorithm, called Restricted Q-learning (RQL), which makes near-optimal decisions on batch splitting. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets show that our methods outperform the state-of-the-arts in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.","['53e9af6eb7602d97039b3c9f', '53e99afeb7602d970238e1fc', '573696ca6e3b12023e5cae04', '53e9b4e9b7602d9704011005', '573695636e3b12023e489398', '53e9aa79b7602d97033ee6fd', '53e99ad7b7602d9702359b57']"

However, knob tuning is an NP-hard problem and existing methods have several limitations. First, DBAs cannot tune a lot of database instances on different environments (e.g., different database vendors). Second, traditional machine-learning methods either cannot find good configurations or rely on a lot of high-quality training examples which are rather hard to obtain. Third, they only support coarse-grained tuning (e.g., workload-level tuning) but cannot provide fine-grained tuning (e.g., query-level tuning).

To address these problems, we propose a query-aware database tuning system QTune with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, which can efficiently and effectively tune the database configurations. QTune first featurizes the SQL queries by considering rich features of the SQL queries. Then QTune feeds the query features into the DRL model to choose suitable configurations. We propose a Double-State Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DS-DDPG) model to enable query-aware database configuration tuning, which utilizes the actor-critic networks to tune the database configurations based on both the query vector and database states. QTune provides three database tuning granularities: query-level, workload-level, and cluster-level tuning. We deployed our techniques onto three real database systems, and experimental results show that QTune achieves high performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art tuning methods.

In this paper, we study the effective use of crowdsourcing in filling missing values in a given relation (e.g., a table containing different attributes of celebrity stars, such as nationality and age). A task given to a worker typically consists of questions about the missing attribute values (e.g., What is the age of Jet Li?). Although this problem has been studied before, existing work often treats related attributes independently, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present T-Crowd, which is a crowdsourcing system that considers attribute relationships. Particularly, T-Crowd integrates each worker's answers on different attributes to effectively learn his/her trustworthiness and the true data values. The attribute relationship information is used to guide task allocation to workers. Our solution seamlessly supports categorical and continuous attributes. Our extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that T-Crowd outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving the quality of truth inference and reducing the monetary cost of crowdsourcing.","['555048b845ce0a409eb70bd6', '599e43470cf290ebfabde1c8', '53e9adb0b7602d97037b18ce', '555048b645ce0a409eb70b25', '58d82fa5d649053542fd01f2', '573698596e3b12023e71fd5d', '5736977f6e3b12023e6669bb', '5c874a3d4895d9cbc6fb441a', '53e99ebdb7602d970278505e', '5a260c8417c44a4ba8a31358', '5550472345ce0a409eb64bfb', '599c7edc601a182cd28d0bcd', '57a4e92fac44365e35c9b626', '573695a56e3b12023e4c3fbb', '53e99d88b7602d97026461e0', '53e99acab7602d9702347c84', '53e9b81cb7602d97043d2970', '573697296e3b12023e61b0e4', '55323bd245cec66b6f9daa8e', '5736973b6e3b12023e62b309', '599c7ede601a182cd28d1734', '53e9a06cb7602d9702950c2f', '53e999ffb7602d970224b36f', '53e9ac28b7602d97035eb779', '53e997fcb7602d9702008e8c', '53e9aa5cb7602d97033cbba0', '56d8732adabfae2eee0419b6', '53e9b023b7602d9703a7f306', '53e99ac4b7602d97023407fe', '57d063a2ac4436735428975d', '53e99c04b7602d97024b063a']"
